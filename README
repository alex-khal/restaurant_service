########### Planck assignment ###########

In this assignment I've created a dish menu service using Flask and Python that processes a given API into
public PostgreSQL DB created using Heroku. The user can query the DB and ger the corresponding results regarding to
dishes in the menu.

########### How to use the service ###########

Testing will be done using Postman
The GET requests are shown as examples to desserts but apply to pizzas and drinks as well.

In order to get all desserts using the route /desserts, please send a GET request.
With body as json the output should be as follows:
{
    "dish_id": 2055835,
    "dish_name": "Tiramisu",
    "dish_description": "",
    "dish_price": 29
},
{
    "dish_id": 2055836,
    "dish_name": "Cheesecake crumbs (no sugar added)",
    "dish_description": "",
    "dish_price": 29
},
{
    "dish_id": 2055837,
    "dish_name": "Tart The Wanderer",
    "dish_description": "",
    "dish_price": 27
}

In order to get all desserts using the route /dessert/<id>, please send a GET request using a certain id.
With body as json the output for id number 2055835 should be as follows:
{
    "dish_id": 2055835,
    "dish_name": "Tiramisu",
    "dish_description": "",
    "dish_price": 29
}

########### Keeping data updated ###########

I didn't get to that part, but I think that some hashing function over the data collected from the api compared to the
one for the current data, and then updating the data if necessary.
